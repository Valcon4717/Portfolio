# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my **personal portfolio**, a fully responsive website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to showcase my skills in front-end development, past experiences, and projects. The portfolio was designed and developed from scratch, inspired by **Aceternity UI** and **Dribbble**, while following **Material Design principles** for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## ‚ú® Features

The design of this portfolio was conceptualized and created entirely by me, focusing on a modern and professional aesthetic. The **color scheme**, **layout**, and overall visuals adhere to Material Design guidelines.
